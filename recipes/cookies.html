    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These melty nutty cookies are a unique spin on the American classic with buckwheat flour acting as the base for
        delciious melty chocolate, which bitterness is balanced by the sweetness of the buckwheat</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>60g (1/3 cup) Bobs Red Mill Buckwheat Groats</li>
        <li>227g (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>250g (2 cups) Bobs Red Mill Buckwheat Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp coarse salt

        </li>
        <li>200gs (1 cup) granulated sugar

        </li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
        <li>113g bittersweet or dark chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>113g white chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pan over medium-low heat, toast the groats until browned around the edges, 3 to 4 minutes,
            tossing frequently. Transfer the groats to a small bowl to fully cool.</li>
        <li>In a medium pan, melt butter over medium heat. Continue to brown the butter until you see flecks of browned
            milk solids and the butter smells of toffee, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the butter in a
            heat safe bowl and allow it to cool.

        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350-degrees and line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk to combine buckwheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk to combine butter and sugar until combined. Add eggs and vanilla and mix until
            combined. Add the dry ingredients and mix with a flexible spatula until a smooth dough forms. Add half of
            the chocolate into the cookie dough and mix to incorporate. Loosely cover the dough with plastic wrap or a
            plate and chill the dough for just 30 minutes. This will help the dough hydrate and also firm up.

        </li>
        <li>Scoop 1 1/2 tbsp of cookie dough and roll into a ball. Dip the top into the remaining chocolate chunks and
            the groats until they stick and then gently roll into a ball again. Place the cookie dough on the baking
            sheet. Repeat with remaining cookies, making sure to space them 3” apart on the sheet. </li>

    </ol>
    <p>Freezing notes: After you’ve rolled your cookie dough balls, freeze them on a small baking sheet and store them
        in a plastic bag once solid. No need to defrost before baking. Bake as you would a fresh cookie, it might just
        need an extra minute or two.
