    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Silky poached eggs perched on a bed of simmered and perfectly spiced tomato sauce. Eat with crusty bread, rice,
        boiled potatoes, or any other carb to absorb the runny yolks and sop up tomato sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon harissa (homemade, if you'd like)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 (2 cups / 300 grams) large red peppers, diced in 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin
        </li>
        <li>5 cups (800 grams) very ripe tomatoes, chopped; canned are also fine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, plus 4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 grams) labneh or thick yogurt</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large frying pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil and then add the harissa, tomato paste, red
            peppers, garlic, cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Saute for about 10 minutes, until the peppers soften. Add the
            tomatoes, bring to a gentle simmer, and cook for another 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Make eight little dips in the sauce. Gently break the eggs and carefully pour each int its own dip. Do the
            same with the yolks, Use a fork to swirl the egg whites a little bit with the sauce, taking care not to
            break the yolks. Simmer gently for 8 to 10 minutes, until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still
            running. Remove from the heat, leave for a couple of minutes to settle, then spoon into individual plates.
            and serve with the labneh or yogurt.</li>
    </ol>
